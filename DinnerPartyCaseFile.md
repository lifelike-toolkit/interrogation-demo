**Captain’s Debrief:**\
Good evening detectives, as you may have known, a month ago, a woman was killed in her own house, surrounded by her family. For the past few weeks, our officers have been hard at work collecting evidence to figure out what exactly happened, and who exactly is to blame for this tragedy. As of right now, we still do not have concrete clues to tie anyone to the murder. Unfortunately, the DA wants the case handled as soon as possible, so we need to find out who the true culprit by sunrise. I know this is a lot to ask of you all, but we need a confession out of one of the suspects. All of you will be provided with a case file that details all that we have on the case, make sure you use it. Everything on there is hard evidence and can be considered as facts. Connor, you will be interrogating the Maid. Huy, I need you to take a crack at the Dad, again. And someone makes sure the Mom doesn’t break down crying in the interrogation room again, the janitor’s been complaining about not having enough mops to clean up that pool of tears. *Everyone leaves the room*.
So, you’re the only one left. Listen, you have been on the case the longest, and between us, I also suspect the Brother. He’s the only one who could’ve done it in my opinion. Since I know you suspect the same, I’ll let you handle this kid. However, the Lawyer lives about 30 minutes away, and he’ll start driving the moment you ask this kid a question. We are kind of lucky he is not already here, because the Dad is frankly still too shaken to think about calling him. Despite what has gone down, the Brother is definitely the calmest of them all, which is strange considering his Sister was just murdered. Just remember, we need a confession, ASAP. You can find inconsistencies and point it out to him or play bad cop and intimidate him. Whatever you do with him, make sure you get him to admit it before the lawyer gets here. He will be a lot more tight-lipped if the Lawyer has him on leash. Get to it, detective.  

**Goal:**\
The force considers everyone to be a probable culprit. You, the Detective, on the other hand, firmly believes that the Suspect is the murderer.
Even with the evidence, there is no direct link to indict the suspect, as anyone could have poisoned the cup. Even though motivation may be clear, the Lawyer is good enough that the Suspect will walk free without a straight confession.
Learning the suspect’s behaviour and get him to confess intentionally or accidentally is the key.

**Background:**\
Family of 4, the Mom, the Dad, the Sister (the Victim) and the Older Brother (the Suspect)
The Dad is filthy rich.
Family dinner party on Friday May 12th, everyone has their own unique set of cutlery (Dad’s a weird guy)
The Lawyer is a family lawyer who works on pretty much everything. He’s the best lawyer money can buy. If you fuck up questioning, he might pull up to defend the Suspect.
The Sister was poisoned to death, deadly amount of poison was found in the cup assigned to her
The Sister and the Brother both are software engineers, but the Sister recently started a big company in second year, while the Brother failed to get a co-op for university.
The Sister dropped dead right before the Dad initiated the opening speech. Nobody knows about the new inheritance.
No one outside of the police knows about the method of murder since everyone involved is a probable culprit. 

**Testimonies:**\
The Lawyer claimed that the sister is going to inherit Dad's fortune. He also claimed that originally, it was going to the Brother (the suspect) who was inheriting it, but the Dad changed his mind on the day before the murder, Thursday May 11th.
The Mom is distraught about the situation, so she remains fairly silent on the matter. 
The Dad was going to announce the new inheritance that day. The Dad states that the cup the Sister drank from that day is his favorite cup, meant to signify her inheriting his fortune. He’s adamant that the poison was meant for him. He suspects the family maid.
The Dad also states that the entire family knows about his favorite cup.
Is in denial that it could be someone from the family. Suspects the family maid. The Dad believes that the Maid had beef with the Victim.
The maid was out of town for the week. Confirmed with CCTV and the Dad and the Mom’s testimonies. The maid also claims to not know about the 
CCTV of the manor’s front entrance confirms that all 4 were present in the mansion. The Dad and the Mom both confirm the presence of each other, the Victim and the Suspect.
