# Focus on Ace Attorney style game.
# Every topic is 1 sentence. This contains Jason's version of the story. The metadata will describe what is happening in the story. Maybe the chief hands you new evidence if you talk about the right thing.
# The tree will also contains evidence topics. If a evidence that proves a contradiction in Jason's version is invoked during that topic, Jason will be fed with the new emotion prompt stored in the metadata.
# Certain topics have the strongest effects to weakening Jason, but the evidence to contradict those only come in late game.
